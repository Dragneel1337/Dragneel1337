# Hey, Adventurer 👋

I'm **Dragneel**, a frontend developer based in **Poland**.

I’m pursuing my childhood dream of becoming a computer specialist — crafting experiences that non-technical people often describe as pure *magic* ✨

I’ve worked on several projects, but my **most notable contribution** so far is the **[Trybik App](https://github.com/TrybikDevelopers/Trybik-frontend-web)**.
